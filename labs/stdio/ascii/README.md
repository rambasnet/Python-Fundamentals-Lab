# CS0 - Lab - Variables and Std IO - ASCII Art

Possible points: 100

## Variables and Std IO Lab A: ASCII Art

Write a Python program that displays some ASCII arts on to the Console/Terminal or standard output using variables.

### Lab Instructions

1. Run labs/stdio/ascii/main.py file as it is to ensure the given lab runs
2. Fix all the FIXMEs and write #fixed# at the end of each FIXME thatâ€™s fixed except at the end of your name and date.
3. The completed lab should produce an output that looks like the following:

```
   |\_/|       *****************************     (\_/)
  / @ @ \      *        ASCII Lab          *    (='.'=)
 ( > 0 < )     *       Ram Basnet          *  ( " )_( " )
   >>x<<       *        Fall 2024          *
  /  O  \      *        CSCI 110           *
               *****************************
```

Note: The figure on the right (looks like a mouse) uses both single ( ' ) and double quotes ( " ) and you must find a way to print both single and double quotes as shown.

4. Create a screenshots folder; create a screenshot of the completed program with the final output displayed on the Terminal and save it into the folder. (10 points)
5. Update your README file (10 points) as shown here: https://github.com/rambasnet/csci000-astudent
6. All FIXMEs are worth equal points unless stated otherwise.

## Submission

- Add all the relevant source file(s), documents, and screenshots into the correct lab folder and do a final add, commit, and push before the due date.

```bash
$ git pull
$ git status
$ git add <each file in the red that is part of this lab>
$ git status
$ git commit -m "Final Submission"
$ git push
$ git status
```

- Check and make sure the files are actually pushed to your remote GitHub repository.
